SPM Linux is a Linux based operating system, built and maintained using SPM (simple package manager)
SPM uses a simple and innovative method that unifies software building and package management

SPM by itself can be used as a standalone build system and package manager on any POSIX system
you need to have "gnunet" program on your system
also to build packages from source, these extra programs are required:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command to install SPM in user's home directory:
; sh spm/install.sh
note that SPM will try to download binary packages (instead of building from source),
	if they are available for your system
if you want to make sure that packages are always built from source, run this instead:
; sh spm/install.sh src

to install SPM Linux on a storage device, first we need to be in a POSIX system with these programs installed:
	gnunet mkfs.vfat mkfs.btrfs
to build packages from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
for example you can boot into an Alpine Linux live system, and enter this at the command line:
; apk add gnunet btrfs-progs
or if you want to build packages from source:
; apk add gnunet btrfs-progs clang git openssh-keygen
now just run this command (as root):
; sh spm/install.sh
or to build packages from source:
; sh spm/install.sh src

the user interface of SPM Linux is very simple
press "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+space" to show the application launcher
the first item in application launcher is "system"; it opens the system menu:
, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
, connections
, timezone
, passwords
, packages (install, remove, upgrade, install SPM Linux)
when there is a space in the text entered in the system menu, it'll be run in a terminal emulator box
	the box will be accessible as a system menu entry labeled with a number followed by the entered command
	to close the box, and remove its entry, press escape
press "super+space" or "alt+tab" repeatedly, to switch between open apps (shown at the left side of taskbar)
	the selected one will be moved to the first place
to close focused window, press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

updating packages is an atomic process
nonetheless, to have a really fail'safe system, redundant backups are necessary
so make sure to have an extra SPM Linux installed on a removable storage device
	system -> packages -> install SPM Linux

to run a program as root:
; sudo <command>
