SPM Linux is a Linux based operating system, built and maintained using SPM (simple package manager)
SPM uses a simple and innovative method that unifies software building and package management,
	as will be explained in the next chapter

to install SPM Linux, first we need to be in a Posix compliant system, with these programs installed:
	fdisk mkfs.vfat mkfs.btrfs gcc g++ git gnunet
for example you can boot into an Alpine Linux live system, then:
; apt add btrfs-progs gcc g++ git gnunet
then run this in a terminal:
; sudo sh install.sh

the user interface of SPM Linux is very simple
press "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab" to show the application launcher
press "super" or "alt+tab" again to go to previously viewed application (if any)
the first item in application launcher is "system"; it opens the system menu:
	, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
	, connections
	, timezone
	, password
	, packages
press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape" to close a window

the package management process is atomic
nonetheless, to have a really fail'safe system, redundant backups are necessary
to create a portable SPM Linux for emergency, go to "system -> packages -> create a portable SPM Linux"
this can also be used to create a cross'compiled SPM Linux

to run a program as root:
; sudo command
this will run a program in virtual terminal 7, that shows the command at the top, and asks for root password,
	and when "enter" is pressed, returns back to previous virtual terminal
press F5 (or F6 or F7 or F8) to go to virtual terminal 7, where one can give root password
if the user is in "sudo" group and the entered password is correct, it runs the command as root
this means that if a malicious program can't steal root password (eg by faking sudo password entry)
and to enter root password, physical access is necessary,
	because there is no other way to enter the password in a virtual terminal
take a look at these:

"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo"
note that it's not possible to login as root; root account is locked

to protect the computer from physical attacks, don't leave the computer with an unlocked session
in addition you must:
, somehow prevent tampering with hardware
, protect boot firmware by a password
, disable changing the storage device used for booting
these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep this in mind:
	physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources
