SPM Linux is a Linux based operating system, built and maintained using SPM (simple package manager)
SPM uses a simple and innovative method that unifies software building and package management

SPM by itself can be used as a standalone build system and package manager on any Posix system
you just need to have either "gnunet" or "curl" on your system
also to build packages from source, these extra programs are required:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command to install SPM in user's home directory:
; sh spm/install.sh
note that SPM will try to download binary packages (instead of building from source),
	if they are available for your system
if you want to make sure that packages are always built from source, run this instead:
; sh spm/install.sh src

to install SPM Linux on a storage device, first we need to be in a Linux system with these programs installed:
	gnunet (or curl) mkfs.vfat (dosfstools) mkfs.btrfs (btrfs-progs) tpm2-tools efivar
to build packages from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command as root:
; sh spm/install.sh
or to build packages from source (agian as root):
; sh spm/install.sh src
this will install a minimal linux based operating system, running Codev, inside Codev Shell
