UPM (unified package manager) uses a simple method to unify software building and package management

UPM is still a work in progress
meanwhile we can use Alpine Linux to implement a prototype of UPM
first we must create a bootable installer on a removable storage device
for that, we just need to be in a Linux system, and run the following command (as root):
; sh alpine/mkinst.sh
now boot into the installation media, and follow the instructions
it provides a user interface based on UShell and Codev

UPM Linux is a Linux based operating system, built and maintained using UPM
to install UPM Linux, first we must create a bootable installer, on a removable storage device
to do that, we must be in a Linux system with these programs installed:
	gnunet (or curl) mkfs.vfat (dosfstools) mkfs.btrfs (btrfs-progs) cryptsetup tpm2-tools
to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command as root:
; sh linux/upm/mkinst.sh
note that UPM will try to download binary packages (instead of building from source),
	if they are available for your system
if you want to make sure that packages are always built from source, run this instead (agian as root):
; sh linux/upm/mkinst.sh src
this will install a minimal Linux based operating system, running Codev inside Ushell

UPM (when ready) by itself can be used as a standalone build system and package manager on any Posix system
you just need to have either "gnunet" or "curl" on your system
in addition, to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command to install UPM in user's home directory:
; sh linux/upm/new.sh
or to build packages from source:
; sh linux/upm/new.sh src
