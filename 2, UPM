UPM (unified package manager) uses a simple method to unify software building and package management

UPM can be used as a build system and package manager on any Posix system
you just need to have either "gnunet" or "curl" on your system
to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command to install UPM in user's home directory:
; sh upm/new.sh
note that UPM will try to download binary packages (instead of building from source),
	if they are available for your system
if you want to make sure that packages are always built from source, run this instead:
; sh upm/new.sh src

furthermore, UPM can be used to build and maintain a Linux based operating system
first we must create a bootable installer on a removable storage device
to do that, we must be in a Linux system with these programs installed:
	gnunet (or curl) mkfs.vfat (dosfstools)
to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command as root:
; sh upm/mkinst.sh
or to build packages from source (agian run as root):
; sh upm/mkinst.sh src
now boot into the installation media, and follow the instructions
this will install a minimal Linux based operating system, providing a user interface using UShell and Codev

packages will be updated automatically
this is safe, since the process of updating packages is atomic

note that UPM is still a work in progress, so the above instructions actually do not work yet
but you can install a prototype of UPM, implemented using Alpine Linux
to do that, we must be in a Linux system with these programs installed:
	curl (or wget) mkfs.vfat (dosfstools)
now just run this command as root:
; sh alpine/mkinst.sh
now boot into the installation media, and follow the instructions
this will install a minimal system based on Alpine Linux, providing a user interface using UShell and Codev
