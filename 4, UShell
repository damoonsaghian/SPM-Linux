UShell is a Wayland shell, based on QuickShell ("https://quickshell.org/")

there is an application launcher which can be toggled by pressing "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab"
applications will be opened in their own workspace,	that will also contain any extra windows opened by that application
to close the focused window, press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

entering "space" as the first character in application launcher, opens terminal emulator
the entered command will be run in a new terminal view, inside a list at the right column
when terminal view finishes its job, if there is any output, it'll be transfered to the history list under the prompt
to navigate between terminal views, use "ctrl+pageup" and "ctrl+pagedown" keys
to go back to the prompt, press "ctrl+tab"
to navigate in history list, use "up" and "down" arrow keys
	you can press enter on an entry to rerun the command, or press space to first edit it
to close a terminal view (that will also kill any running process) press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

the first item in the application launcher is "system", which opens the system menu:
, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
, connections
, timezone
, passwords
, packages (install, remove, update, make installation media)
, backup (create, restore)

to have a really fail'safe system, redundant units are necessary
you can create a backup on a removable storage device
backups will be done using "BTRFS send", so they will be incremental and fast
the backup device is encrypted, and contains a backup of your home directory
	dencryption can be done using a password, as well as a key stored on the computer
each time the device is connected, the backup procedure will be run automatically
even in case of bit rot for data in home directory, this procedure repairs it automatically
this backup can be easily restored on a new system
these systems will then form an F2F network using GNUnet, through which they will be synced to each other
