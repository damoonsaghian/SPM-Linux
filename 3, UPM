Uni is build and installed using UPM
UPM (unified package manager) uses a simple method to unify software building and package management

UPM can be used to build and maintain a Linux based operating system, with UShell and Uni as the user interface
first we must create a bootable installer on a removable storage device
to do that, we must be in a Linux system with these programs installed:
	curl (or wget) mkfs.vfat (dosfstools)
to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command as root:
; sh uinst/mkinst.sh
note that UPM will try to download binary packages (instead of building from source),
	if they are available for your system
if you want to make sure that packages are always built from source, run this instead (agian run as root):
; sh uinst/mkinst.sh src
now boot into the installation media, and follow the instructions

packages in the installed system will be updated automatically
this is safe, since the process of updating packages is atomic

UPM is still a work in progress, so the above instructions actually installs a prototype based on Alpine Linux
when UPM is ready, Uni can be installed on any Posix system
you just need to have either "curl" or "wget" on your system
to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command (as normal user):
; sh uinst/inst.sh
or to build packages from source:
; sh uinst/inst.sh src
