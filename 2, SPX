SPX is a POSIX'compliant operating system, built and maintained using SPM (simple package manager)
SPM uses a simple and innovative method that unifies software building and package management

SPM by itself can be used as a standalone package manager on any POSIX system with these programs installed:
	sed gnunet
to build packages from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
now just run this command to install SPM in user's home directory:
; sh spm/install.sh
to build packages from source, run this instead:
; sh spm/install.sh src

to install SPX, first we need to be in a POSIX system with these programs installed:
	sfdisk mkfs.vfat mkfs.btrfs sed gnunet
to build packages from source, these extra programs are required too:
	clang git ssh-keygen
for example you can boot into an Alpine Linux live system, and enter this at the command line:
; apk add sfdisk btrfs-progs gnunet
to build packages from source, add these too: clang git openssh-keygen

now, SPX can be installed on a storage device, just by running this command (as root):
; sh spm/install.sh <arch>
if no architecture is provided, current system's architecture will be used
to build packages from source, run this instead:
; sh spm/install.sh src <arch>

the user interface of SPX is very simple
press "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+space" to show the application launcher
the first item in application launcher is "system"; it opens the system menu:
, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
, connections
, timezone
, passwords
, packages (install, remove, upgrade, install SPX)
when there is a space in the text entered in the system menu, it'll be run in a terminal emulator box
	the box will be accessible as a system menu entry labeled with a number followed by the entered command
	to close the box, and remove its entry, press escape
press "super+space" or "alt+tab" repeatedly, to switch between open apps (shown at the left side of taskbar)
	the selected one will be moved to the first place
to close focused window, press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"

updating packages is an atomic process
nonetheless, to have a really fail'safe system, redundant backups are necessary
so make sure to have an extra SPX on a removable storage device

to run a program as root:
; sudo <command>
