<h2>1, Uni</h2><div>Uni is a unified collaborative development environment, and an ideal frontend for GNUnet,
</div><div>	with command'based user interface
</div><div>
</div><div>command'based user interfaces (using keyboard, voice, gesture) are faster, more convenient and more powerful,
</div><div>	than pointer'based user interfaces (using mouse, touch, pen)
</div><div>pointer'based interface seems appealing at first sight, because of its discoverability
</div><div>but with simple uniform GUI (ie the oposite of what we see in websites),
</div><div>	there is no need for a pointer based user interface
</div><div>touch interface has an additional problem: interaction at a distance is not possible
</div><div>note that, touch interface can be useful in special cases, but it's not good as a general purpose interface
</div><div>detection of voice commands is a relatively simple process (compared to general speech recognition),
</div><div>	because we only need to match against a relatively small set of commands
</div><div>for those who neither can use all their fingers, nor can talk, gesture based (2d) input can be implemented
</div><div>
</div><div>list of all projects will appear in a floating layer, at the center of the screen, called overview layer
</div><div>overview layer:
</div><div>, left panel:
</div><div>	, roots: home directory, plus attached devices
</div><div>	, project groups: content of roots
</div><div>, main view:
</div><div>	projects: content of project groups
</div><div>
</div><div><img src="uni.png" alt="uni.png"/>
</div><div>
</div><div>in a project view, the list of files of a project will be displayed in the left side'bar
</div><div>opened files will be slightly highlighted
</div><div>files and directories with names starting with a dot, will be hidden
</div><div>".cache" directory inside a project is for files we don't want to share or backup
</div><div>
</div><div>each opened file will have a side'bar at right showing its sections
</div><div>there we can create new view corresponding to a section
</div><div>sections with views will be slightly highlighted
</div><div>
</div><div>text files will be opened in a text editor
</div><div>directories containing media files, will be opened in a gallery view
</div><div>files and directories inside a gallery, will be opened in a floating layer
</div><div>
</div><div>non'local projects, web pages, PDF documents, etc, accessed from links inside the main project,
</div><div>	will be opened in a floating layer
</div><div>web pages: move caret between visual elements (ignoring structural elements)
</div><div>
</div><div>actions:
</div><div>, next/previous word, line, paragraph, section
</div><div>	ask before crossing files
</div><div>, next/previous section view, opened file
</div><div>, go to the list of files to open a file view
</div><div>, go to the list of sections to open a section view
</div><div>, start and end selection, then copy or cut
</div><div>, paste
</div><div>, undo
</div><div>
</div><div>, navigation: move, search
</div><div>, selection
</div><div>, completion
</div><div>
</div><div>right click or ctrl+enter: show a list of available commands and their key bindings
</div><div>
</div><div><b>collaborative development</b>
</div><div>flaws of version control systems:
</div><div>, they double the storage (working directory, local repository)
</div><div>, their design makes it difficult to modify the history
</div><div>	so in practice, the whole history must be kept indefinitely, even if not needed
</div><div>
</div><div>when we download a project, a pristine copy is kept untouched in ".cache/ude/pristine",
</div><div>	and ref links will be created in the working directory, and then we can work on our own branch
</div><div>after a while when we want to pull and merge changes made in the main branch,
</div><div>	first a three'way diff will be shown, based on the main branch, pristine, and the working directory,
</div><div>	then the user will be asked to accept all or some parts of the diff
</div><div>to send a pull request to the main branch, first publish the pristine and the working directory (except .cache),
</div><div>	then send the two addresses to the main developer
</div><div>	the main developer will make a diff based on these two, plus her own working directory
</div><div>
</div><div>we can use GNUnet to share files in a P2P (a opposed to client'server) network

<h2>2, computers</h2><div>computers can help people to easily access and improve human knowledge,
</div><div>	and as a result do things to improve the quality of human life
</div><div>
</div><div>an ideal computer would be a combination of a smart'phone and a PC
</div><div>, in smart'phone mode, CPU works in cool mode, which doesn't need a fan
</div><div>, in PC mode, it will be put on a cooler
</div><div>the computer itself contains CPU, RAM, SSD, TPM2, Bluetooth, and a USB4 2.0 port that will connect to a hub
</div><div>the hub provides:
</div><div>, power, powerful GPU and WiFi
</div><div>, a USB dock (to connect peripherals like display, camera ...)
</div><div>, compatibility ports for older devices: ethernet, audio jack, DP and HDMI
</div><div>to act as a smart'phone it also has battery, integrated GPU, a small display, camera, speaker, microphone, WiFi and cell
</div><div>during boot, the integrated GPU is used, to prevent any vulnerability due to the OptionROM of external GPU
</div><div>
</div><div><b>the ideal keyboard</b>
</div><div><img src="keyboard.png" alt="keyboard.png"/>
</div><div>
</div><div>navigation keys (arrows, page up, page down, home, end, esc), and ctrl/shift/alt based keybindings,
</div><div>	are available by pressing and holding "mod" key
</div><div>pressing one "mod" key while holding the other one, is equivalent to Super key
</div><div>
</div><div>to insert punctuations (in insert mode), press "pun"
</div><div>	after entering a punctuation charactor, it automatically returns to normal mode
</div><div>	unless the "pun" key is still pressed, in which case, it will return to normal mode after releasing "pun"
</div><div>to insert numbers, press and hold "num"
</div><div>
</div><div>pressing and releasing "Fn", sends "Super+L" key press (usually bound to session locking)
</div><div>holding "Fn" and pressing a number eg 1, sends "F1" key
</div><div>
</div><div>to insert capital letters, press comma then press the letter
</div><div>to insert an all capital word, press two commas
</div><div>	the following letters will be inserted in capitalized form, until space is pressed
</div><div>this is how it is implemented:
</div><div>when comma key is pressed, keyboard enters the cap mode in which:
</div><div>, pressing a letter key, sends a "backspace" key, and then the capitalized form of that letter,
</div><div>	and then the cap mode will be canceled
</div><div>, pressing comma again, sends a "backspace" key, and activates caps mode,
</div><div>	which remains active until space (or enter or mod) is pressed
</div><div>, pressing any other keys, acts like normal, and cancels the cap mode

</div><div>
</div><div><b>digital circuits</b>
</div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change, the outputs can have temporary invalid values,
</div><div>	until they stabilize to the valid values
</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job, gates with memory (registers),
</div><div>	must operate only when the inputs have correct values
</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal
</div><div>	the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable
</div><div>
</div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:
</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,
</div><div>	which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining)
</div><div>	otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient
</div><div>, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated
</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics
</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not
</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,
</div><div>	i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits
</div><div>
</div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:
</div><div>, next to any data wire, there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not
</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,
</div><div>	for a duration equal to the delay of one gate
</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs
</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated
</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid
</div><div>
</div><div><b>computer architecture</b>
</div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals, this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers
</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one
</div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,
</div><div>	from a program written in a structured and human readable language
</div><div><a href="https://www.bottomupcs.com/">https://www.bottomupcs.com/</a>
</div><div>
</div><div>backdoors are always a possibility for closed'source CPU with closed'source boot firmware
</div><div>specially after the introduction of "trusted execution environment" (TEE) in the boot firmwares
</div><div>TEE is a full'blown, always'running mini operating system,
</div><div>	with full access to the whole system (including memory and network)
</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it
</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors
</div><div><a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/intel-me-and-why-we-should-get-rid-of-me">https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/intel-me-and-why-we-should-get-rid-of-me</a>

</div><div>
</div><div>in the case of X86 architecture, the default boot firmware of nearly all systems are closed source
</div><div>flashing a CoreBoot based boot firmware is possible, but there still will be closed source parts (Intel FSP)
</div><div>in addition, there is no easy way to get rid of the TEE part, ie Intel ME (or AMD PSP),
</div><div>	though there are some hacks to disable (but not completely remove) it:
</div><div>	<a href="https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/">https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/</a>
</div><div>
</div><div>ARM architecture is closed source too, but some vendors (eg Rockchip) use an open source boot firmware (EDK2)
</div><div>there is even an open source implementation of ARM TrustZone: <a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/">https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/</a>
</div><div>GPU with open source driver: Qualcomm/Adreno
</div><div>
</div><div>open source CPU: RISC-V, Power ISA
</div><div>
</div><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware
</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel
</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system),
</div><div>	and it can be useful for some use cases (like embedded systems),
</div><div>	but a kernel based operating system makes developing and testing programs, much easier
</div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel
</div>
<h2>3, installation</h2><div>Uni is build and installed using UPM (unified package manager)
</div><div>UPM uses a simple method to unify software building and package management
</div><div>
</div><div>ULinux is a Linux based operating system, build and maintain using UPM
</div><div>the user interface of ULinux is based on UShell and Uni
</div><div>to install Ulinux, first we must create a bootable installer on a removable storage device
</div><div>to do that, we must be in a Linux system with these programs installed:
</div><div>	curl (or wget) mkfs.vfat (dosfstools)
</div><div>to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
</div><div>	clang git ssh-keygen
</div><div>now just run this command:
</div><div>; sh ulinux/inst/new.sh
</div><div>now boot into the installation media, and follow the instructions
</div><div>
</div><div>packages in the installed system will be updated automatically
</div><div>this is safe, since the process of updating packages is atomic
</div><div>
</div><div>UPM is still a work in progress, so the above instructions actually installs a prototype based on Alpine Linux
</div><div>when UPM is ready, Uni can be installed on any Posix system
</div><div>you just need to have either "curl" or "wget" on your system
</div><div>to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
</div><div>	clang git ssh-keygen
</div><div>now just run this command:
</div><div>; sh upm/install.sh
</div><div>
</div><div><b>Ushell</b>
</div><div>Ushell is a Wayland shell, based on QuickShell (<a href="https://quickshell.org/">https://quickshell.org/</a>)
</div><div>
</div><div>there is an application launcher which can be toggled by pressing "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab"
</div><div>applications will be opened in their own workspace,	that will also contain any extra windows opened by that application
</div><div>to close the focused window, press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"
</div><div>
</div><div>entering "space" as the first character in application launcher, opens terminal emulator
</div><div>the entered command will be run in a new terminal view, inside a list at the right column
</div><div>when terminal view finishes its job, if there is any output, it'll be transfered to the history list under the prompt
</div><div>to navigate between terminal views, use "ctrl+pageup" and "ctrl+pagedown" keys
</div><div>to go back to the prompt, press "ctrl+tab"
</div><div>to navigate in history list, use "up" and "down" arrow keys
</div><div>	you can press enter on an entry to rerun the command, or press space to first edit it
</div><div>to close a terminal view (that will also kill any running process) press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape"
</div><div>
</div><div>the first item in the application launcher is "system", which opens the system menu:
</div><div>, session (lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff)
</div><div>, connections
</div><div>, timezone
</div><div>, passwords
</div><div>, packages (install, remove, update, make installation media)
</div><div>, backup (create, restore)
</div><div>
</div><div>to have a really fail'safe system, redundant units are necessary
</div><div>you can create a backup on a removable storage device
</div><div>backups will be done using "BTRFS send", so they will be incremental and fast
</div><div>the backup device is encrypted, and contains a backup of your home directory
</div><div>	dencryption can be done using a password, as well as a key stored on the computer
</div><div>each time the device is connected, the backup procedure will be run automatically
</div><div>even in case of bit rot for data in home directory, this procedure repairs it automatically
</div><div>this backup can be easily restored on a new system
</div><div>these systems will then form an F2F network using GNUnet, through which they will be synced to each other
