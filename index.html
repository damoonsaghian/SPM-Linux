<h2>1, computers</h2><div>computers must be portable devices with a USBC (USB4 without PCIe) port,</div><div>	which connects to a display and also provides power</div><div>ports on the display: USB dock, ethernet, audio jack, DP and HDMI</div><div>the display also has speakers, camera, light sensor and auto brightness</div><div>the computer itself should also include those mentioned extra ports,</div><div>	for situation that such a display is not available</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>digital circuits</b></div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change, the outputs can have temporary invalid values,</div><div>	until they stabilize to the valid values</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job, gates with memory (registers),</div><div>	must operate only when the inputs have correct values</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal</div><div>	the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable</div><div><p></p></div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,</div><div>	which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining)</div><div>	otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient</div><div>, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,</div><div>	i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits</div><div><p></p></div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:</div><div>, next to any data wire, there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,</div><div>	for a duration equal to the delay of one gate</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>computer architecture</b></div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals, this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one</div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,</div><div>	from a program written in a structured and human readable language</div><div><a href='https://www.bottomupcs.com/'>https://www.bottomupcs.com/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>there is always the possibility of backdoors for closed source CPU,</div><div>	especially if the boot firmware is also closed source</div><div>recently introduction of "secure execution environment" makes this situation even worse</div><div>it's a closed source, full'blown, always'running mini operating system,</div><div>	with full access to the whole system (including memory and network)</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors</div><div><a href='https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/intel-me-and-why-we-should-get-rid-of-me'>https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/intel-me-and-why-we-should-get-rid-of-me</a></div><div><a

href='https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf'>https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>on X86 architectures the default boot firmware on nearly all systems are closed source</div><div>flashing a CoreBoot based boot firmware is possible, but there still will be closed source parts (Intel FSP)</div><div>in addition, there is no easy way to get rid of Intel ME (or AMD PSP),</div><div>	though there are some hacks to disable (but not completely remove) it:</div><div>	<a href='https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/'>https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>ARM architecture is closed source too, but in most cases, boot firmwares are open source (U-Boot or EDK2)</div><div>ARM TrustZone can host an open source operating system too, apparently:</div><div>	<a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17783357'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17783357</a></div><div>GPU with open source driver: Qualcomm/Adreno</div><div><p></p></div><div>open source CPU: RISC-V, Power ISA</div><div><p></p></div><div>boot firmware must have a read'only part and an updatable part</div><div>this way an interrupted flashing does not brick the device</div><div>also the read'only part checks the signature of the updatable part, to make sure it's not malicious</div><div><p></p></div><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system),</div><div>	and it can be useful for some use cases (like IoT devices),</div><div>	but a kernel based operating system makes developing and testing programs, much easier</div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel</div>
<h2>2, SPM Linux</h2><div>SPM Linux is a Linux based operating system, built and maintained using SPM (simple package manager)</div><div>SPM uses a simple and innovative way that unifies software building and package management</div><div>	it's explained in the next chapter</div><div><p></p></div><div>to install SPM Linux, first we need to be in a Posix compliant system, with these packages installed:</div><div>	gcc g++ bison flex texinfo gawk zip gmp-dev mpfr-dev mpc1-dev zlib-dev git fdisk btrf-progs</div><div>then run this in a terminal:</div><div>; sudo sh install.sh</div><div><p></p></div><div>the user interface of SPM Linux is very simple</div><div>press "super" (mod+mod) or "alt+tab" to show the main menu</div><div>press "super" or "alt+tab" again to go to previously viewed application (if any)</div><div>the main menu contains two views:</div><div>, the first view shows the list of installed GUI applications</div><div>, the second view provides a command'line (to switch to it, press any punctuation character)</div><div>	it will run the entered command, and when it exits, the menu will be closed</div><div>	the default command which will be run when empty line is entered, is "system"</div><div>using "system" one can:</div><div>	, manage session: lock, suspend, exit, reboot, poweroff</div><div>	, manage connections</div><div>	, set timezone</div><div>	, change passwords</div><div>	, manage packages</div><div>press "super+backspace" or "alt+escape" to close a window</div><div><p></p></div><div>the package management process is atomic</div><div>nonetheless, to have a really fail'safe system, redundant backups are necessary</div><div>one can make a portable SPM Linux for emergency, using "system" command</div><div>	just select "create a portable SPM Linux" from "manage packages" section</div><div>this can also be used to create a cross'compiled SPM Linux</div><div><p></p></div><div>to run a program as root:</div><div>; sudo command</div><div>this will switch to the first available virtual terminal, shows the command at the top,</div><div>	and asks for root password</div><div>if the user is in "sudo" group and the entered password is correct,</div><div>	it returns back to previous virtual terminal, and runs the command as root</div><div><p></p></div><div>note that you can't login as root; root account is locked</div><div>this means that if a malicious program steals root password (eg by faking sudo password entry),</div><div>	it still can't run programs as root (because it can't enter the password in a virtual terminal)</div><div>also you must never type the user's password anywhere except at the login prompt</div><div>	and make sure the login prompt isn't fake, by pressing "F1" or "XF86Lock" for locking/unlocking</div><div>take a look at these:</div><div><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/'>https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8mlil7/whats_the_point_of_the_sudo_password_prompt_if/</a></div><div><a href='https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo'>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119410/why-should-one-use-sudo</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>to protect the computer from physical attacks, don't leave the computer with an unlocked session</div><div>in addition you must:</div><div>, somehow prevent tampering with hardware</div><div>, protect boot firmware by a password</div><div>, disable changing the storage device used for booting</div><div>these can make physical attacks more difficult, but keep this in mind:</div><div>	physical access to a computer is root access, given enough time and resources</div>
<h2>3, SPM</h2><div>SPM packages are simple source code directories containing a "spmbuild.sh" file</div><div>the script puts all output files in .cache/spm under the source code directory</div><div><p></p></div><div>to install a package:</div><div>; spm add &lt;package-name&gt; [&lt;gnunet-or-git-url&gt;]</div><div>; spm add &lt;gnunet-or-git-url&gt;</div><div>here is what happens:</div><div>, the source from the given URL will be downloaded to "../state/spm/packages/&lt;url-hash&gt;"</div><div>	(this path is relative to the path of the directory containing "spm" program)</div><div>, when no URL is given, it means to install a package already present in "../state/spm/packages/&lt;package-name&gt;",</div><div>	which is the case for builtin packages, and customized packages</div><div>, the "spmbuild.sh" script of the package will be executed</div><div>, if a package name is given and "../state/spm/packages/&lt;package-name|url-hash&gt;/.cache/spm/0" file exists:</div><div>	, it creates hard links from "../state/spm/packages/&lt;package-name|url-hash&gt;/.cache/spm/" to</div><div>		"../apps/&lt;package-name&gt;/"</div><div>	, it creates a symbolic link from "../apps/&lt;package-name&gt;/0" to "./&lt;package-name&gt;"</div><div>	, it creates a symbolic link from "../apps/&lt;package-name&gt;/0.desktop" to</div><div>		"../share/applications/&lt;package-name&gt;.desktop"</div><div>	, the package name and URL (if any) will be put into "../state/spm/autoupdate-list"</div><div>, if a package name is given and in "../state/spm/&lt;package-name|url-hash&gt;/.cache/spm":</div><div>	, "fonts" directory exist, symlink it to "../share/fonts/&lt;package-name&gt;"</div><div>	, "icons" directory exist, symlink it to "../share/icons/&lt;package-name&gt;"</div><div>	, ...</div><div>	, the package name and URL (if any) will be put into "../state/spm/autoupdate-list"</div><div><p></p></div><div>public keys for packages downloaded from a URL can be stored in "../spm/keys/&lt;url-hash&gt;"</div><div>spm uses these keys to check the signature of packages when downloading/updating them</div><div><p></p></div><div>if you want to customize configurations for an SPM package:</div><div>, create "../state/spm/packages/&lt;package-name&gt;/spmbuild.sh"</div><div>, put this line in the script:</div><div>	spm add &lt;gnunet-or-git-url&gt;</div><div>, add your custom configs</div><div>, run: spm add &lt;package-name&gt;</div><div>this way to customize packages, without the need for "/etc"</div><div><p></p></div><div>SPM packages do not need dependency tracking</div><div>because all the dependencies will be hard'linked to the same directory alongside the executable</div><div>for removing a package, just remove "../apps/&lt;package-name&gt;" directory, plus these symlinks (if any):</div><div>	./&lt;package-name&gt;</div><div>	../share/applications/&lt;package-name&gt;.desktop</div><div>	../share/fonts/&lt;package-name&gt;</div><div>	../share/icons/&lt;package-name&gt;</div><div>	...</div></body></html>
