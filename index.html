<h2>1, computers</h2><div>computers can help people to easily access and improve human knowledge,
</div><div>	and as a result do things to improve the quality of human life
</div><div>
</div><div>Unic (unified computer) is a combination of a smart'phone and a PC
</div><div>it contains CPU, RAM, SSD, TPM2, Bluetooth, and a USB4 2.0 port that will connect to a hub
</div><div>the hub provides:
</div><div>, power, powerful GPU, WiFi
</div><div>, a USB dock (to connect peripherals like display, camera ...)
</div><div>, extra ports: ethernet, audio jack, DP and HDMI
</div><div>to act as a smart'phone it also has battery, integrated GPU, a small display, camera, speaker, microphone, WiFi and cell
</div><div>
</div><div>note that the OptionROM of external GPU (whose code will be run at boot) will not cause a vulnerability,
</div><div>	if during boot, the integrated GPU is used instead
</div><div>
</div><div>in smart'phone mode, CPU works in cool mode which does not need a fan
</div><div>in PC mode, Unic will be put on a cooler
</div><div>
</div><div><b>digital circuits</b>
</div><div>in conventional digital circuits when the inputs change, the outputs can have temporary invalid values,
</div><div>	until they stabilize to the valid values
</div><div>but for the circuit to do its job, gates with memory (registers),
</div><div>	must operate only when the inputs have correct values
</div><div>one solution is to synchronize registers with a global clock signal
</div><div>	the period of clock signal is made long enough for the circuit to become stable
</div><div>
</div><div>disadvantages of synchronous circuits:
</div><div>, we have to split long operations into several smaller ones,
</div><div>	which can be performed in successive clock cycles (a technique known as pipelining)
</div><div>	otherwise the circuit would be slow and inefficient
</div><div>, distributing a high'fan'out, timing'sensitive clock signal can be complicated
</div><div>, electromagnetic interference at the clock frequency and its harmonics
</div><div>, widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not
</div><div>although "clock gating" can help to reduce some of the problems of synchronous circuits,
</div><div>	i think the real solution is to use asynchronous circuits
</div><div>
</div><div>the only sane kind of asynchronous circuit which i could imagine is this:
</div><div>, next to any data wire, there is a control wire which determines if the data is valid or not
</div><div>, when a register wants to change its outputs, it first invalidates them,
</div><div>	for a duration equal to the delay of one gate
</div><div>, any gate receiving an invalid input, invalidates its outputs
</div><div>, this way all data which is going to change in the future, is first invalidated
</div><div>, registers operate only when all inputs are valid
</div><div>
</div><div><b>computer architecture</b>
</div><div>cpu, memory, peripherals, this seems to be the only practical architecture for the hardware of computers
</div><div>cpu runs a sequence of simple computations, called instruction codes, one by one
</div><div>compilers are special programs that generate instruction codes,
</div><div>	from a program written in a structured and human readable language
</div><div><a href="https://www.bottomupcs.com/">https://www.bottomupcs.com/</a>
</div><div>
</div><div>backdoors are always a possibility for closed'source CPU with closed'source boot firmware
</div><div>specially after the introduction of "trusted execution environment" (TEE) in the boot firmwares
</div><div>TEE is a full'blown, always'running mini operating system,
</div><div>	with full access to the whole system (including memory and network)
</div><div>furthermore they have made it practically impossible for users to disable it
</div><div>this mess of a design cries out for hidden and quite sophisticated backdoors
</div><div><a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/intel-me-and-why-we-should-get-rid-of-me">https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/intel-me-and-why-we-should-get-rid-of-me</a>

</div><div>
</div><div>in the case of X86 architecture, the default boot firmware of nearly all systems are closed source
</div><div>flashing a CoreBoot based boot firmware is possible, but there still will be closed source parts (Intel FSP)
</div><div>in addition, there is no easy way to get rid of the TEE part, ie Intel ME (or AMD PSP),
</div><div>	though there are some hacks to disable (but not completely remove) it:
</div><div>	<a href="https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/">https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/</a>
</div><div>
</div><div>ARM architecture is closed source too, but some vendors (eg Rockchip) use an open source boot firmware (EDK2)
</div><div>there is even an open source implementation of ARM TrustZone: <a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/">https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/</a>
</div><div>GPU with open source driver: Qualcomm/Adreno
</div><div>
</div><div>open source CPU: RISC-V, Power ISA
</div><div>
</div><div>programs usually do not run directly on computer hardware
</div><div>instead they run on a more sophisticated software machine (a virtual machine) called the kernel
</div><div>in theory we can live without a kernel (an idea sometimes called a library operating system),
</div><div>	and it can be useful for some use cases (like embedded systems),
</div><div>	but a kernel based operating system makes developing and testing programs, much easier
</div><div>Linux is a highly developed, constantly evolving, open'source kernel
</div>
<h2>2, SPM Linux</h2><div>SPM Linux is a Linux based operating system, built and maintained using SPM (simple package manager)
</div><div>SPM uses a simple and innovative method that unifies software building and package management
</div><div>
</div><div>SPM by itself can be used as a standalone build system and package manager on any Posix system
</div><div>you just need to have either "gnunet" or "curl" on your system
</div><div>in addition, to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
</div><div>	clang git ssh-keygen
</div><div>now just run this command to install SPM in user's home directory:
</div><div>; sh spm/new.sh
</div><div>note that SPM will try to download binary packages (instead of building from source),
</div><div>	if they are available for your system
</div><div>if you want to make sure that packages are always built from source, run this instead:
</div><div>; sh spm/new.sh src
</div><div>
</div><div>to install SPM Linux on a storage device, first we need to be in a Linux system with these programs installed:
</div><div>	gnunet (or curl) mkfs.vfat (dosfstools) mkfs.btrfs (btrfs-progs) cryptsetup tpm2-tools
</div><div>to bootstrap from source, these extra programs are required too:
</div><div>	clang git ssh-keygen
</div><div>now just run this command as root:
</div><div>; sh spm/new.sh
</div><div>or to build packages from source (agian as root):
</div><div>; sh spm/new.sh src
</div><div>this will install a minimal linux based operating system, running Codev, inside CodevShell
</div><div>
</div><div>packages will be updated automatically
</div><div>updating packages is an atomic process
</div><div>nonetheless, to have a really fail'safe system, redundant systems are necessary
</div><div>also SPM Linux is easily replicatable using the command "spm new"
