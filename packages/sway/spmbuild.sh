# this is to prevent normal users from changing Sway's config
# this means that, swayidle can't be disabled by a normal user (see sway.conf)

# hardlink swaycap.py to swaycap and make it executable

# lock screen:
# a window in workspace "lockscreen" that asks for password
# when lock screen is activated, sway goes to "lock" mode with its own set of keybindings
# if an empty password is entered, or "escape" is pressed, show a readonly view of the projects
# 	note that external storage devices will be writable
# when one trys to edit readonly files, or when "alt+tab" is pressed, or when "escape" is pressed in the root window,
# 	show the password entry
# during boot, the user will be automatically logged in, and the lock screen will be activated
# when lock window is closed, reopen it

# after 600 seconds idle, lock
# idle can be monitored using a user service)
# dim screen in several steps before locking

# to prevent BadUSB, when a new input device is connected lock the session
# a user service checks when "/spm/installed/system/new-input-added" file is created, locks the session
# mdev rule that when an input device (ATTR{bInterfaceClass}=="03") is added:
# 	 touch /spm/installed/system/new-input-added

# mono'space fonts:
# , wide characters are forced to squeeze
# , narrow characters are forced to stretch
# , bold characters donâ€™t have enough room
# proportional font for code:
# , generous spacing
# , large punctuation
# , and easily distinguishable characters
# , while allowing each character to take up the space that it needs
